= curliff README file

A little tool for removing spurious carriage returns from
a text file; it converts the combination CRLF (pronounced "curliff")
at the end of each text line to the single line feed character LF.

This tool is useful for situations in which a text file must be moved
back and forth between Windows and Unix systems.
