= curliff

curliff is a tiny tool for removing spurious carriage returns from
a text file. It converts the combination CRLF (pronounced "curliff")
at the end of each text line to the single line feed character LF.

This tool is useful for situations in which a text file must be moved
back and forth between Windows and Unix systems.

To be built, it requires make, a C compiler, and asciidoctor to
format the documentation.

Building and installing curliff is straightforward. Simply, run:

----
make && sudo make install
----

The reference manual is accessible as usual:

----
man curliff
----
